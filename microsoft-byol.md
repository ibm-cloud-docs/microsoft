# Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
{: #microsoft-byol}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} supports Bring Your Own Licenses (BYOL). Microsoft has had a specific set of rules that customers should follow when using their licenses on cloud providers from 2019. On August 29th, 2022 Microsoft changed their policy with two announcements. The first customer [announcement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/news/options-for-hosted-cloud){: external} states that Microsoft BYOL can be deployed on shared (multi-tenant hosts). Previously this was limited to dedicated (single-tenant) hosts. Customers should read and understand the new terms and conditions. The [blog](https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/new-licensing-benefits-make-bringing-workloads-and-licenses-to-partners-clouds-easier/){: external} posting discusses this in more detail. Basically, when a customer uses BYOL, they will be able to license Windows Server by virtual core instead of physical cores.

Customers should review these revised rules and their current spending and usage patterns to determine which deployment model makes the most financial and technical performance sense. Some workloads are steady state and require consistent infrastructure and some workloads are bursty and can be cycled on and off to take advantage of hourly pricing.

Depending on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} solution, Microsoft software is purchased pay as you go (hourly, monthly, yearly) on shared and dedicated resources. For BYOL, Microsoft currently limits their software to dedicated hosts which are priced on a monthly and yearly basis.
