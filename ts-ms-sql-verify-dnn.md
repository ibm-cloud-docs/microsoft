Use the `Resolve-DnsName` PowerShell command to see that the DNN has been configured correctly in DNS. See the following result for a 3 node cluster, where the DNN name `dnnlsnr` resolves to the three nodes:

```sh
Resolve-DnsName -Name dnnlsnr

Name                                     Type   TTL   Section    IPAddress
