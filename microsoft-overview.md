# Overview of Microsoft on IBM
{: #microsoft-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} has a diverse set of IaaS offerings that span 60 datacenters, in 9 regions and 18 availability zones. The server hardware includes the latest processors from [Intel](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/intel), [AMD](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/amd) and GPUs from [NVIDIA](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/gpu). We provide provisioning and orchestration access through our web interface, API, CLI  and 3rd party applications. Standard and custom images are supported for flexibility to match customer workload requirements. Security is embedded in every step to keep your data safe. 

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has a strategic relationship with Microsoft to offer their suite of software. We offer their software natively in our cloud offerings and as Bring Your Own Licenses (BYOL). Customers should review their current spending and usage patterns to determine which deployment model makes the most financial and technical performance sense. 

Depending on the IBM Cloud solution, Microsoft software is purchased pay as you go (hourly, monthly, yearly) on shared and dedicated resources. For BYOL, Microsoft currently limits their software to dedicated hosts which are priced on a monthly and yearly basis. IBM is a Listed Provider for [Microsoft Cloud Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/news/updated-licensing-rights-for-dedicated-cloud){: external} and [License Mobility for Microsoft Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility){: external}.
