# Overview of Microsoft on IBM

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has a strategic relationship with Microsoft to offer their suite of software. We offer their software natively in our cloud offerings and as Bring Your Own Licenses (BYOL). Customers should review their current spending and usage patterns to determine which deployment model makes the most financial and technical performance sense.

Depending on the IBM Cloud solution, Microsoft software is purchased pay as you go (hourly, monthly, yearly) on shared and dedicated resources. Microsoft has recently changed their BYOL policy. Please see the [Microsoft BYOL](https://{DomainName}/docs/microsoft?topic=microsoft-microsoft-byol) page for latest information. IBM is a Listed Provider for [Microsoft Cloud Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/news/updated-licensing-rights-for-dedicated-cloud){: external} and [License Mobility for Microsoft Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility){: external}.
