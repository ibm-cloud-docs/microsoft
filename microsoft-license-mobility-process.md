# License Mobility Deployment Process

## Step-by-step deployment overview 
{: #microsoft-license-mobility-process-overview}

Review the License Mobility through Software Assurance Verification Guide for Customers. This document can guide you through the [process](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/9/b/79bd917e-760b-48b6-a266-796b3e47c47a/License_Mobility_Customer_Verification_Guide.pdf){: external}.

**1. Determine your license eligibility.**

Decide which eligible products you want to deploy with Microsoft Azure or an Authorized Mobility Partner and how many licenses you require. Typically, the IT or procurement department in your organization can access the [Microsoft licensing agreement details](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com){: external}. For a list of eligible products, refer to the [Product Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com){: external}.

* Active Software Assurance is required on all licenses for eligible products.
* Where applicable, you must maintain appropriate Client Access Licenses (CALs) with  active Software Assurance.

**2. Choose a License Mobility through Software Assurance Partner.**

You may choose Microsoft Azure or an eligible Service Provider as a License Mobility through Software Assurance Partner. Find the [list of partners](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility.aspx){: external}. Make sure the partner is a good match for your organizationâ€™s objectives and deployment plan.

**3. Fill out a verification form.**

Find the [license verification form for your region](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx){: external}.
The form asks you for your Agreement Number, Enrollment Number, and Software Assurance expiration date, so make sure that you have the information available. Guidance for completing the form is at the License Mobility web page listed in step 2.

A new form is required if you add a product, renew Software Assurance, or switch Authorized Mobility Partners.

**4. Submit the verification form to Microsoft.**

Your Microsoft channel partner can help you fill out the form properly and submit it to Microsoft on your behalf.

**5. Deploy your solution.**

Work with your Authorized Mobility Partner to deploy the solution in their server farm. You can deploy while you wait for confirmation from Microsoft on your eligibility for License Mobility.
