# Dual MZR - Active Directory
{: #mssql-mzrad}

This section steps through the build tasks needed to create an additional Active Directory and Domain Name Server (ADDNS) server for the recovery MZR, and join it to the existing forest\domain in the primary MZR. This creates a highly available active directory across the MZRs. 
{: shortdesc}

This guide assumes that you:

* Have created your VPC and subnets as your requirements dictate.
* Have configured the security groups.
* Have uploaded SSH keys.
* You have configured an Active Directory forest with at least one domain controller.

## Order a virtual server
{: #mssql-mzad-order}

A virtual server of the following specification is suitable for an ADDNS server host and can be ordered using the instructions at [Creating virtual server instances by using the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers).

* **Profile:** bx2-2x8
* **Type:** Public
* **OS:** WIndows 2019
* **NIC Qty:** 1
* **Data Volumes:** None

## Connect to the server
{: #mssql-mzad-connect}

After the virtual server has been deployed you need to connect a Floating IP address to it so that you can access the server remotely, refer to [Adding a floating IP address](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-instance-vnics#adding-floating-ip).

Refer to [Connecting to Windows instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_is_connecting_windows) to access the Windows Administrator's password, however, in short the following commands are used from your laptop, where the instances command returns the <INSTANCE_ID> of the virtual server:

```text
ibmcloud is instances
ibmcloud is instance-initialization-values <INSTANCE_ID> --private-key @~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
{: codeblock}

## Add a domain controller
{: #mssql-mzad-dc}

To add a domain controller to the existing forest\domain, the following commands are used:

* The `Get-DnsClientServerAddress` captures the Interface Index for the IPv4 Ethernet interface, so that the DNS can be changed from the IBM Cloud DNS server to the ADDNS server. The `Install-ADDSDomainController` uses DNS to lookup the IP address of an existing domain controller.
* Use `Set-DnsClientServerAddress` to set the <ADDNS_IP_Address> to the existing ADDNS server.
* Create a secure string for the domain administrator's password for use in the credential variable `$credential`.
* Install the AD features on the server using the `Install-WindowsFeature` command.
* Install the server as a domain controller in the <Domain_Name> domain, e.g. sqlserver.test, using a Safe Mode Administrator Password of <SafeModeAdministratorPassword>. This password should adhere to your required standards and kept securely.
* The server will reboot.

```text
$dns = "<ADDNS_IP_Address>"
$domainnb = "<NB_Domain>"
$user = $domainnb + "\Administrator"
$password = "<password>"
$domainfull = <Domain_Name>
$smpassword = "<Safe_Mode_Admin_Password>"
$out=Get-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias Ethernet -AddressFamily IPv4 | Select-Object -Property InterfaceIndex
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex $out.InterfaceIndex -ServerAddresses ($dns)
$secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($user, $secpassword)
Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName $domainfull -InstallDns:$true -Credential $credential -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString $smadminpassword -AsPlainText -Force) -Force
```
