# Licensed Mobility through Microsoft Software Assurance Overview
{: #microsoft-license-mobility}

## Overview 
{: #microsoft-license-mobility-overview}

Organizations around the world are benefitting from the power, flexibility, and efficiency of cloud computing. Whether you want to deploy server applications in a traditional customer on- premises environment, through a partner or a Microsoft cloud-hosted model, or a combination of all three, Microsoft gives you the flexibility to choose what is right for you, on your terms and on your schedule.

## License mobility through Microsoft Software Assurance
{: #microsoft-license-mobility-sw}

With more businesses adopting Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), customers moving server workloads and applications to the cloud want to take advantage of their existing licensing investments as part of their IT strategy.

License Mobility through Microsoft Software Assurance gives Microsoft Volume Licensing customers the flexibility to deploy certain server applications with active Software Assurance on-premises or in the cloud, without having to buy additional licenses. As a result, customers can take advantage of the lowest and flexible cost infrastructure for changing business priorities.
Because of this new Software Assurance benefit, customers do not need to purchase new Microsoft Client Access Licenses (CALs), and no associated mobility fees exist.

## Products eligible for License mobility through Software Assurance
{: #microsoft-license-mobility-products}

For specific Microsoft server products, [License Mobility through Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-license-mobility?rtc=1#tab=3){: external} gives customers enhanced flexibility. A customer can assign their application server licenses with active Software Assurance to run server instances on shared hardware via Microsoft Azure or a License Mobility through Software Assurance Partner’s data center. Although sharing hardware, such server instances (virtual machines) must be dedicated to a single customer and are not shared with other customers.

The list of eligible server applications includes Microsoft SQL Server database software, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint Server, Microsoft Skype for Business Server, Microsoft System Center servers, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Server for Customer Service and Sales applications. (Note: For SQL Server customers with core-based licensing and Software Assurance coverage, broader benefits are available under [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/){: external} rights. For more information, see Azure Hybrid Benefit. The steps described below do not apply to Azure Hybrid Benefit use.) The Windows Server operating system licenses remain assigned to customers’ on-premises hardware with their applicable license terms. For additional information and a full list of eligible products, please refer to the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/product-licensing/products?rtc=1){: external}.
